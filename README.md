👋 Hey there! I'm Suyash Verma

I’m a B.Tech CSIT student passionate about how Data Science and Generative AI can transform ideas into intelligent, real-world solutions.

I love working with Python, SQL, and modern AI frameworks like LangChain and Hugging Face, creating projects that blend creativity with data-driven insights.

Right now, I’m diving deep into Machine Learning, Deep Learning, NLP, and Generative AI, learning how intelligent systems can learn, reason, and create.

 My goal is to grow into a Data Scientist & GenAI Engineer — building AI that doesn’t just process data, but truly understands it.
